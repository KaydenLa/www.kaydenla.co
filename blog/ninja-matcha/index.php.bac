	A key driver for the success of tasty tea house is the prime location within the Dun Huang Plaza. This plaza is a common attraction and meeting place for all groups of people.The Dun Huang plaza is a vital part of the community and frequently makes improvemens for their visitors. As recently as Winter 2023, the plaza made major upgrade in public space amenities by creating a picnic center within the middle of the plaza. This new attraction is complete with five benches that are full of art created by the local community.<br>
	It is important to note that due to the high visitor count that the plaza receives, parking may be abnormal. To combat the influx of visitors (especially during the weekends) Dun Huang Plaza is completed by two multistory parking garages.
