		About the Blog!        </h2> 
	Documented within the blog are the outings that I go on, primarily focused within the Greater Houston Area, Texas. These trips often consit of me visiting coffee shopes, tea houses, parks, and late night adventures.<br>
	Beyond these laid back adventures, I occasionally post techincal guides. These guides are generally focused on a comibation of game modding, full stack web development, and random niche sectors that I find are lacking in quality content. I generally do not make too many of these posts, but sometimes I find myself scrolling for hours trying to solve what could have been a 10 minute problem with if given a proper guide.<br>
	Thanks for reading my blog!<br>
	- Kayden L.
